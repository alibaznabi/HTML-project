                    <p> Register with the HOM-NFT minting system and provide proof that you own the property. If you own pHOM or HOM tokens, it's free to use the system.</p>

                    <p> Next, enter all the information about your property. This “meta-data” is the key to your HOM-NFT. In some places HOM DAO may already have complied the meta-data for the profperty. </p>

                    Once the meta-data is collected, minting your HOM-NFT takes seconds. HOM AI bots ensure your NFT meta-data remains up to date and is powered with the latest market data and trends. </p>

            <p class="onepara">Bonding a HOM-NFT is the same idea as bonding crypto, but using real estate instead.. You may bond your HOM-NFT and get up to 110% of the value of your property in HOM tokens, depending upon the eco-rating of the property.</p>

                <p class="onepara">Once you’ve bonded the HOM-NFT, you can do what you want with your HOM tokens, including staking your HOM tokens to earn passive income. The smart move is to use the staking awards to pay off your HOM bond early and keep the rest to do with as you please.</p>

Sell the day-NFT’s to people who want to use your property on those days. When they stay at your property the day-NFT is used up. It's all paid for with crypto. Simple.</p>

You can even sell fractions of the HOM-NFT to lots of people in exchange for HOM tokens. This way, those who had never before had the chance to participate in real-estate ownership, can join in. </p>
